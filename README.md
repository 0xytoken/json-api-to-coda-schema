# Simply & Effortlessly create a Coda Schema for your API within seconds ‚è±

1. Call the API with a sample value

      ```f.e. https://api.opensea.io/api/v1/collection/boredapeyachtclub```

2. Copy the JSON response and call the parser function on it ```jsonToCodaSchema(YUOR_COPIED_JSON_RESPONSE)```

*** Et Voila! ***

Now, you have an extensive coda schema tailored to your API. 

NOTE: You might have to adjust the result to remove the ```***TODO***``` values, as they are placeholders for empty Arrays and Objects, for which you have to manually define the expected type.
